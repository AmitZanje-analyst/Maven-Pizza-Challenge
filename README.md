Sales data for 2015 from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

 ## ðŸ”¸Key Strategic RecommendationsðŸ”¸

âœ…Store hours should be altered to 10am-10pm for better manpower allocation. 'Happy Opening hours' could be used to boost morning sales.  
âœ…Performance of XL size Greek Pizza is encouragement for addition if newer extra-large size pizza's
